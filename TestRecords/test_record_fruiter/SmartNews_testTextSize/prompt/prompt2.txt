I want to navigate to settings and adjust text size, in which navigate to settings may be accomplished in Setting page, adjust text size may be accomplished in Setting page.
I have finished the following actions:
    (Step 1 in MainUnsupportedVersion page) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'settingButton', 'class': 'ImageButton', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': 'downloadProgressBar', 'sibling_nodes': 'logoContainer, refreshButton', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Step 2) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'LinearLayout', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'title/News, title/General, title/Data saving, title/External services', 'child_nodes': 'titleTextView/Article font size, valueTextView/Normal'}.
Current function GUI page is Setting, which has the following texts: 'Article font size', 'Normal', 'Large', 'CANCEL'.
Current GUI page seems like TwitterAuth page, and it have the following widgets that can be operated:
    (Widget Id: 0) {'action': 'click', 'text': 'Normal', 'resource-id': 'text1', 'class': 'CheckedTextView', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': 'select_dialog_listview', 'sibling_nodes': 'text1/Large', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 1) {'action': 'click', 'text': 'Large', 'resource-id': 'text1', 'class': 'CheckedTextView', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': 'select_dialog_listview', 'sibling_nodes': 'text1/Normal', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 2) {'action': 'click', 'text': 'CANCEL', 'resource-id': 'button2', 'class': 'Button', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': ''}.
Which widget id should I operate in this GUI page?
Let's think step by step for one action and answer strictly in accordance with the following format: (Thought: <Reasoning> Action: <Widget Id> Input: <Input Text>).
Note that <Widget Id> is -1 only when the entire task is complete, don't end the task when there are still steps, and don't do any extra operation after completing the task, such as going back to the home page, just output '-1'.
Note that <Input Text> is required when the action you choose is 'text', and provide the words you want to enter.
You can try swipe down this page or close this page to go back to the previous page and continue the task if you can't find the target widget, which means <Widget Id> should not be -1.
Note that the role of the previous step and the current page widgets is considered, and remember to check whether the target widget has already been operated in the previous steps.
