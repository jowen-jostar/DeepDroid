5miles is a mobile shopping app that allows users to buy, sell, and discover items locally, offering a wide range of products from electronics to fashion.
All its main function pages are: Welcome, MainTab, TabProfile, Report, ItemLocationMap, Profile, MyProfile, FmWeb, GuidePager.
I want to sign in and navigate to the about section in the app settings, in which sign in may be accomplished in TabProfile page, navigate to the about section in the app settings may be accomplished in Profile page.
This is the first action.
Current function GUI page is Welcome, which has the following texts: 'Make money fast, with whatever you have to sell', 'Continue with Facebook', 'Continue with Google', 'Register', 'Sign In'.
Current GUI page seems like Unknown page, and it have the following widgets that can be operated:
    (Widget Id: 0) {'action': 'swipe', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'image_pager', 'class': 'ViewPager', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'img_guide, guide_wrapper, guide_text/Make money fast, with whatever you have to sell'};
    (Widget Id: 1) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'FrameLayout', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': 'fb_login_placeholder', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'fb_login_btn_clickable/Continue with Facebook'};
    (Widget Id: 2) {'action': 'click', 'text': 'Continue with Google', 'resource-id': 'btn_google_login', 'class': 'TextView', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 3) {'action': 'click', 'text': 'Register', 'resource-id': 'sign_up', 'class': 'Button', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'sign_in/Sign In', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 4) {'action': 'click', 'text': 'Sign In', 'resource-id': 'sign_in', 'class': 'Button', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'sign_up/Register', 'child_nodes': ''}.
Which widget id should I operate in this GUI page?
Let's think step by step for one action and answer strictly in accordance with the following format: (Thought: <Reasoning> Action: <Widget Id> Input: <Input Text>).
Note that <Widget Id> is -1 only when the entire task is complete, don't end the task when there are still steps, and don't do any extra operation after completing the task, such as going back to the home page, just output '-1'.
Note that <Input Text> is required when the action you choose is 'text', and provide the words you want to enter.
You can try swipe down this page or close this page to go back to the previous page and continue the task if you can't find the target widget.
Note that the role of the previous step and the current page widgets is considered, and remember to check whether the target widget has already been operated in the previous steps.
