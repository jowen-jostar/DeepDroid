I want to search for llama and select the first result in the news app, in which search for "llama" in the news app may be accomplished in SearchNavigation page, select the first result may be accomplished in ArticleDetail page.
I have finished the following actions:
    (Step 1 in NewsFeedNavigation page) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'search_the_app', 'class': 'TextView', 'content-desc': 'Search for news and sections', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'settings_gear', 'child_nodes': ''}.
Current function GUI page is Navigation, which has the following texts: 'Search for news and sections'.
Current GUI page seems like SearchNavigation page, and it have the following widgets that can be operated:
    (Widget Id: 0) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'image_search_back', 'class': 'ImageButton', 'content-desc': 'Up navigation button', 'parent_node': 'linearLayout_search', 'sibling_nodes': 'edit_text_search/Search for news and sections, voice_sarch', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 1) {'action': 'text', 'text': 'Search for news and sections', 'resource-id': 'edit_text_search', 'class': 'EditText', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': 'linearLayout_search', 'sibling_nodes': 'image_search_back, voice_sarch', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 2) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'voice_sarch', 'class': 'ImageButton', 'content-desc': 'Voice Search', 'parent_node': 'linearLayout_search', 'sibling_nodes': 'image_search_back, edit_text_search/Search for news and sections', 'child_nodes': ''}.
Which widget id should I operate in this GUI page?
Let's think step by step for one action and answer strictly in accordance with the following format: (Thought: <Reasoning> Action: <Widget Id> Input: <Input Text>).
Note that <Widget Id> is -1 only when the entire task is complete, don't end the task when there are still steps, and don't do any extra operation after completing the task, such as going back to the home page, just output '-1'.
Note that <Input Text> is required when the action you choose is 'text', and provide the words you want to enter.
You can try swipe down this page or close this page to go back to the previous page and continue the task if you can't find the target widget, which means <Widget Id> should not be -1.
Note that the role of the previous step and the current page widgets is considered, and remember to check whether the target widget has already been operated in the previous steps.
