BBC News is a trusted global news app providing up-to-date coverage on international news, politics, business, technology, and more, directly from the British Broadcasting Corporation.
All its main function pages are: TopLevel, SubMenuSettings, Item, PictureGalleryGrid, WidgetConfigure.
I want to select category from menu and choose the second category option, in which open the menu and select a category may be accomplished in MainNavigation page, choose the second option from the category list may be accomplished in SubMenuSettings page.
I have finished the following actions:
    (Step 1 in MainNavigation page) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'ImageView', 'content-desc': 'More options', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'action_search', 'child_nodes': ''}.
Current function GUI page is TopLevel, which has the following texts: 'Settings', 'Help', 'Contact us', 'Other BBC apps'.
Current GUI page seems like SettingsMenu page, and it have the following widgets that can be operated:
    (Widget Id: 0) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'LinearLayout', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'content, title/Settings'};
    (Widget Id: 1) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'LinearLayout', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'content, title/Help'};
    (Widget Id: 2) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'LinearLayout', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'content, title/Contact us'};
    (Widget Id: 3) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'LinearLayout', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'content, title/Other BBC apps'}.
Which widget id should I operate in this GUI page?
Let's think step by step for one action and answer strictly in accordance with the following format: (Thought: <Reasoning> Action: <Widget Id> Input: <Input Text>).
Note that <Widget Id> is -1 only when the entire task is complete, don't end the task when there are still steps, and don't do any extra operation after completing the task, such as going back to the home page, just output '-1'.
Note that <Input Text> is required when the action you choose is 'text', and provide the words you want to enter.
You can try swipe down this page or close this page to go back to the previous page and continue the task if you can't find the target widget, which means <Widget Id> should not be -1.
Note that the role of the previous step and the current page widgets is considered, and remember to check whether the target widget has already been operated in the previous steps.
