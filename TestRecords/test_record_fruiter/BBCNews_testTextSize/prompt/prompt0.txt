All its main function pages are: TopLevel, SubMenuSettings, Item, PictureGalleryGrid, WidgetConfigure.
I want to test text size by navigating through more options and settings menus, in which navigate through the more options menu may be accomplished in MainNavigation page, navigate through the settings menu may be accomplished in SettingsMenu page, test the text size may be accomplished in Settings page.
This is the first action.
Current function GUI page is TopLevel, which has the following texts: .
Current GUI page seems like MainNavigation page, and it have the following widgets that can be operated:
    (Widget Id: 0) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'ImageButton', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': 'toolbar', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 1) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'action_search', 'class': 'TextView', 'content-desc': 'Search', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 2) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'ImageView', 'content-desc': 'More options', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'action_search', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 3) {'action': 'long-click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'ImageView', 'content-desc': 'More options', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'action_search', 'child_nodes': ''}.
Which widget id should I operate in this GUI page?
Let's think step by step for one action and answer strictly in accordance with the following format: (Thought: <Reasoning> Action: <Widget Id> Input: <Input Text>).
Note that <Widget Id> is -1 only when the entire task is complete, don't end the task when there are still steps, and don't do any extra operation after completing the task, such as going back to the home page, just output '-1'.
Note that <Input Text> is required when the action you choose is 'text', and provide the words you want to enter.
You can try swipe down this page or close this page to go back to the previous page and continue the task if you can't find the target widget, which means <Widget Id> should not be -1.
Note that the role of the previous step and the current page widgets is considered, and remember to check whether the target widget has already been operated in the previous steps.
