I want to navigate to menu and select first category in explore section, in which navigate to menu may be accomplished in MainContentNavigator page, select first category in explore section may be accomplished in MainContentPager page.
I have finished the following actions:
    (Step 1 in MainContentPager page) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'FrameLayout', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'smallLabel/Explore, icon'};
    (Step 2) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'explore_item', 'class': 'FrameLayout', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': 'explore_recyclerView', 'sibling_nodes': 'explore_item', 'child_nodes': 'explore_item_title/Shopping'}.
Current function GUI page is Buffet, which has the following texts: 'Shopping'.
Current GUI page seems like BuffetSearch page, and it have the following widgets that can be operated:
    (Widget Id: 0) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'ImageButton', 'content-desc': 'Navigate up', 'parent_node': 'toolbar', 'sibling_nodes': 'actionbar_title_text/Shopping', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 1) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'menu_search', 'class': 'TextView', 'content-desc': 'Searchâ€¦', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': ''}.
Which widget id should I operate in this GUI page?
Let's think step by step for one action and answer strictly in accordance with the following format: (Thought: <Reasoning> Action: <Widget Id> Input: <Input Text>).
Note that <Widget Id> is -1 only when the entire task is complete, don't end the task when there are still steps, and don't do any extra operation after completing the task, such as going back to the home page, just output '-1'.
Note that <Input Text> is required when the action you choose is 'text', and provide the words you want to enter.
You can try swipe down this page or close this page to go back to the previous page and continue the task if you can't find the target widget, which means <Widget Id> should not be -1.
Note that the role of the previous step and the current page widgets is considered, and remember to check whether the target widget has already been operated in the previous steps.
