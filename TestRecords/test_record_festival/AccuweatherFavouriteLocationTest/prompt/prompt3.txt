AccuWeather app is a weather forecasting application that provides real-time weather updates, forecasts, and alerts for locations worldwide.
All its main function pages are: Onboarding, Splash, Main, WhatsNew.
I want to set London as favourite without enabling notification, in which set London as favourite without enabling notification may be accomplished in MainLocationSelector1 page.
I have finished the following actions:
    (Step 1 in MainWeatherDashboard page) {'action': 'click', 'text': 'Mountain View, CA', 'resource-id': 'location_button', 'class': 'Button', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': 'global_toolbar', 'sibling_nodes': 'affiliate_logo', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Step 2 in MainLocationSelector page) {'action': 'text', 'text': 'Find Location', 'resource-id': 'location_search_box', 'class': 'EditText', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': 'location_search', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Step 3 in MainLocationSelector1 page) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'action_icon_container_added', 'class': 'ViewGroup', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'location_text/London, London, GB', 'child_nodes': 'action_icon_image_add_favorite, action_icon_text_add_favorite/Favorite'}.
Current function GUI page is Main, which has the following texts: 'Location added to Favorites', 'Would you like to receive notifications for London, United Kingd...', 'RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS', 'NO THANKS'.
Current GUI page seems like Unknown page, and it have the following widgets that can be operated:
    (Widget Id: 0) {'action': 'click', 'text': 'RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS', 'resource-id': 'button1', 'class': 'Button', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'button2/NO THANKS', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 1) {'action': 'click', 'text': 'NO THANKS', 'resource-id': 'button2', 'class': 'Button', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'button1/RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS', 'child_nodes': ''}.
Which widget id should I operate in this GUI page?
Let's think step by step for one action and answer strictly in accordance with the following format: (Thought: <Reasoning> Action: <Widget Id> Input: <Input Text>).
Note that <Widget Id> is -1 only when the entire task is complete, don't end the task when there are still steps.
Note that <Input Text> is required when the action you choose is 'text', and provide the words you want to enter.
You can try swipe down this page or close this page to go back to the previous page and continue the task if you can't find the target widget.
Note that the role of the previous step and the current page widgets is considered, and remember to consider whether the target widget has already been operated in the previous steps.
