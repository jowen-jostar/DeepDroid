The SoundHound app is a music identification and discovery service that allows users to identify songs playing around them, discover new music, and access lyrics and playlists.
All its main function pages are: SoundHound, URLRouter, WidgetRouter, WidgetPermission, SoundHoundIdNow, IdNowRouter, CreateShortcutIdNow, NewTaskLauncher, ViewDatabaseError, ViewInternalWebview, ViewFreemiumStatus, PageHost, VideoPlayerPage, NoActionBarNoNavBarPageHost, OMR, PlayerPage, ViewMusicSearchResults, ViewSaySearchResults, ViewAudioSearchResultListItems.
I want to Open settings and clear search history, in which open settings may be accomplished in Settings page, clear search history may be accomplished in MainNavigation page.
I have finished the following actions:
    (Step 1 in Unknown page) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'nav_history', 'class': 'FrameLayout', 'content-desc': 'History', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'nav_search, nav_playlist_collection', 'child_nodes': 'icon, smallLabel/History'};
    (Step 2 in MusicDiscoveryHome page) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'settings_button', 'class': 'ImageView', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'account_status/Log In or Sign Up', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Step 3 in Settings page) {'action': 'swipe', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'recycler_view', 'class': 'RecyclerView', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': 'list_container', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'title/Song Playback, title/Sharing, title/Voice Search (“Hey SoundHound…”)'};
    (Step 4 in Settings page) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'LinearLayout', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': 'recycler_view', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'title/Clear My History'}.
Current function GUI page is Settings, which has the following texts: 'Are you sure you want to delete your History?', 'CANCEL', 'DELETE'.
Current GUI page seems like AccountSignUpError page, and it have the following widgets that can be operated:
    (Widget Id: 0) {'action': 'click', 'text': 'CANCEL', 'resource-id': 'button2', 'class': 'Button', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'button1/DELETE', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 1) {'action': 'click', 'text': 'DELETE', 'resource-id': 'button1', 'class': 'Button', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'button2/CANCEL', 'child_nodes': ''}.
Which widget id should I operate in this GUI page?
Let's think step by step for one action and answer strictly in accordance with the following format: (Thought: <Reasoning> Action: <Widget Id> Input: <Input Text>).
Note that <Widget Id> is -1 only when the entire task is complete, don't end the task when there are still steps.
Note that <Input Text> is required when the action you choose is 'text', and provide the words you want to enter.
You can try swipe down this page or close this page to go back to the previous page and continue the task if you can't find the target widget.
Note that the role of the previous step and the current page widgets is considered, and remember to consider whether the target widget has already been operated in the previous steps.
