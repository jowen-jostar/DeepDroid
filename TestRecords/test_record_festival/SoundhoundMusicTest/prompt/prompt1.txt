The SoundHound app is a music identification and discovery service that allows users to identify songs playing around them, discover new music, and access lyrics and playlists.
All its main function pages are: SoundHound, URLRouter, WidgetRouter, WidgetPermission, SoundHoundIdNow, IdNowRouter, CreateShortcutIdNow, NewTaskLauncher, ViewDatabaseError, ViewInternalWebview, ViewFreemiumStatus, PageHost, VideoPlayerPage, NoActionBarNoNavBarPageHost, OMR, PlayerPage, ViewMusicSearchResults, ViewSaySearchResults, ViewAudioSearchResultListItems.
I want to Play Christmas Music, in which Play Christmas Music may be accomplished in PlayerPage page.
I have finished the following actions:
    (Step 1 in MainNavigationPage page) {'action': 'long-click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'nav_search', 'class': 'FrameLayout', 'content-desc': 'Search', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'nav_history, nav_playlist_collection', 'child_nodes': 'icon, largeLabel/Search'}.
Current function GUI page is OMR, which has the following texts: 'Dusting off the records'.
Current GUI page seems like OMRPage page, and it have the following widgets that can be operated:
    (Widget Id: 0) {'action': 'swipe', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'scroll_view', 'class': 'ScrollView', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'close_button, msg_container', 'child_nodes': 'text_switcher, tip_text_one/Dusting off the records, omrCenterSpacer, ad_spacer'};
    (Widget Id: 1) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'close_button', 'class': 'ImageView', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'scroll_view, msg_container', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 2) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'omr_button', 'class': 'View', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'text_switcher, omrCenterSpacer, ad_spacer', 'child_nodes': ''}.
Which widget id should I operate in this GUI page?
Let's think step by step for one action and answer strictly in accordance with the following format: (Thought: <Reasoning> Action: <Widget Id> Input: <Input Text>).
Note that <Widget Id> is -1 only when the entire task is complete, don't end the task when there are still steps.
Note that <Input Text> is required when the action you choose is 'text', and provide the words you want to enter.
You can try swipe down this page or close this page to go back to the previous page and continue the task if you can't find the target widget.
Note that the role of the previous step and the current page widgets is considered, and remember to consider whether the target widget has already been operated in the previous steps.
