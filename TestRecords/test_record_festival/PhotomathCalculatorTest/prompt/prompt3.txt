The Photomath app is a mobile application that allows users to take pictures of handwritten or printed mathematical equations and provides instant step-by-step solutions and explanations.
All its main function pages are: Launcher, Main, NoPlayServices.
I want to Open the advanced calculator, in which Open the advanced calculator may be accomplished in HelpSettingsPage page.
I have finished the following actions:
    (Step 1 in MainCameraFunctionPage page) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': 'help_icon', 'class': 'ImageButton', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': 'container', 'sibling_nodes': 'compose_view, camera_fragment_container, menu_icon, editor_icon/Calculator, gallery_fragment_container, my_stuff_icon', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Step 2 in HelpSettingsPage page) {'action': 'swipe', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'ScrollView', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'Camera adjustment, Capture your entire math problem within the white lines by adjus..., Advanced calculator'};
    (Step 3 in HelpSettingsPage page) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'View', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'Advanced calculator', 'child_nodes': ''}.
Current function GUI page is Help, which has the following texts: 'Capture your entire math problem within the white lines by adjus...', 'Advanced calculator', 'How to use'.
Current GUI page seems like HelpSettingsPage page, and it have the following widgets that can be operated:
    (Widget Id: 0) {'action': 'swipe', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'ScrollView', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'Capture your entire math problem within the white lines by adjus..., Advanced calculator'};
    (Widget Id: 1) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'View', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'Capture your entire math problem within the white lines by adjus...', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 2) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'View', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'Advanced calculator', 'child_nodes': ''};
    (Widget Id: 3) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'Button', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'How to use', 'child_nodes': ''}.
Which widget id should I operate in this GUI page?
Let's think step by step for one action and answer strictly in accordance with the following format: (Thought: <Reasoning> Action: <Widget Id> Input: <Input Text>).
Note that <Widget Id> is -1 only when the entire task is complete, don't end the task when there are still steps.
Note that <Input Text> is required when the action you choose is 'text', and provide the words you want to enter.
You can try swipe down this page or close this page to go back to the previous page and continue the task if you can't find the target widget.
Note that the role of the previous step and the current page widgets is considered, and remember to consider whether the target widget has already been operated in the previous steps.
