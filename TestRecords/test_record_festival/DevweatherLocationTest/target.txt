Please give me the page with the function that best matches the following tasks:
    (1) go to settings;
    (2) turn off the use of current location.
Please answer with a sentence in which the order of the page names corresponds strictly to the order of the tasks, and the page names are separated by ';'.
Note that the page name should be selected from the name of the explored page mentioned above, and if there is no page that matches the corresponding task, select one of the function pages above to return.
Note that the page name should appear exactly as it appears above, and do not make any typos.
Note that you should output the page names only.
Output example: MainLocation; MainSetting1.
