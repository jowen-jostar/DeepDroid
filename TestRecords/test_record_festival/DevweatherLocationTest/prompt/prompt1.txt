The DevWeather app is a weather forecasting application designed specifically for developers, offering real-time weather data and APIs for integration into software projects.
All its main function pages are: Main, AppPreferences, AppWidgetPreferences, About, CityList, AppList, CalList.
I want to Go to settings and turn off the use of current location, in which go to settings may be accomplished in AppPreferences page, turn off the use of current location may be accomplished in AppPreferences page.
I have finished the following actions:
    (Step 1 in MainLocationWeather page) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'ImageView', 'content-desc': 'More options', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': 'menu_refresh, menu_share', 'child_nodes': ''}.
Current function GUI page is Main, which has the following texts: 'Add', 'Delete', 'Widget Settings'.
Current GUI page seems like MainWidgetManager page, and it have the following widgets that can be operated:
    (Widget Id: 0) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'LinearLayout', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'content, title/Add'};
    (Widget Id: 1) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'LinearLayout', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'content, title/Delete'};
    (Widget Id: 2) {'action': 'click', 'text': '', 'resource-id': '', 'class': 'LinearLayout', 'content-desc': '', 'parent_node': '', 'sibling_nodes': '', 'child_nodes': 'content, title/Widget Settings'}.
Which widget id should I operate in this GUI page?
Let's think step by step for one action and answer strictly in accordance with the following format: (Thought: <Reasoning> Action: <Widget Id> Input: <Input Text>).
Note that <Widget Id> is -1 only when the entire task is complete, don't end the task when there are still steps.
Note that <Input Text> is required when the action you choose is 'text', and provide the words you want to enter.
You can try swipe down this page or close this page to go back to the previous page and continue the task if you can't find the target widget.
Note that the role of the previous step and the current page widgets is considered, and remember to consider whether the target widget has already been operated in the previous steps.
